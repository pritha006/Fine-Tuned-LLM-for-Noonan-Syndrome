Noonan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects normal development in
various parts of the body. It is characterized by distinctive facial features,
short stature, congenital heart defects, and developmental delays.

Common symptoms include hypertelorism (wide-set eyes), low-set ears,
webbed neck, chest deformity, and delayed puberty.

Diagnosis is based on clinical features, genetic testing, and cardiac evaluation.
Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and may include surgery, growth hormone
therapy, and regular monitoring.
